# BuildLogger
Quick and dirty build log command line tool for the flight log app.

Interim solution until the mobile app is done.

Right now I'm inputting build logs directly into the database which is not ideal. Especially if I make a spelling error. Zenith makes its build guide available in PDF's and I will be setting up a Raspbery Pi in the work area dedicated to showing those PDF's as I work. Bringing my laptop to the garage and back is a pain. As long as I have that set up I might as well also use it for the build log. I also have a tendancy to neglect my phone battery so the mobile build log may not be the best solution for me, aside from having an excuse to learn Flutter.
